# Impeccable

Use the requested design direction and existing product evidence. Keep work scoped to the requested surface.

## Context And Verification

These routing rules govern setup output and linked playbooks: sufficient brief, code, and visual context permit implementation without a broad interview or mandatory init. Ask only about unresolved decisions that materially affect the result; never simulate user approval. Missing PRODUCT.md or DESIGN.md alone is not a blocker. Use init when requested or when product discovery is genuinely needed, not as a prerequisite for every new surface.

Inspect actual images before using them as references or accepting generated assets. For visual edits, open screenshots of affected states: representative mobile and desktop layouts for responsive web changes, or affected native device classes. Select locales by copy/layout risk, including long text or RTL when relevant; expand for shared changes or observed defects. Trigger reveal animations before capture. Batch fixes and recheck them; stop discretionary polishing, not unresolved correctness or accessibility defects. Report coverage and blockers rather than claiming unperformed visual checks.

## Setup

1. When project context needs discovery, run `node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs` from the user's project; pass a named file or route as `--target <path>`. Reuse its output unless project or target context changes. The loaded base directory resolves script paths in this skill and its references; `.agents/skills/impeccable` is the fallback when none is reported. It loads PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, surface briefs, and native guidance. Apply relevant findings subject to Context And Verification above, including when output says `BUILD_INIT_REQUIRED` or `PRODUCT_INIT_REQUIRED`.
2. Load the request's playbook: its Commands-table reference for an explicit/implied sub-command, or [reference/new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for a new surface or replacement visual world. Inspect target and incumbent visual truth before editing. When the app cannot run, start with committed visual-regression goldens or screenshot fixtures; verify target and freshness against current tokens, CSS, components, or assets, resolve conflicts, and compare theme/variant captures.
3. Before UI implementation, load [reference/craft-floor.md](reference/craft-floor.md) for applicable craft and accessibility checks. Skip it for planning-only work; the explicit brief and scope govern aesthetic prescriptions.

## How to design

- **The brief wins.** Honor pinned aesthetics, eras, materials, fonts, and palettes even when they conflict with a saturated-pattern warning. Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure.
- **Refinement preserves; redesign replaces.** Refinement keeps the incumbent identity, behavior, copy, and everything outside scope. Ask before replacing factual copy or adding claims. Redesign keeps product truth, content, function, native affordances, and constraints, but treats the old look as evidence and anti-reference; choose a replacement world in new-work and replace DESIGN.md. Never split the difference into polish on the discarded look.
- **Visual authority is evidence, not a filename.** Missing DESIGN.md alone does not make a project greenfield; new-work decides whether to preserve, expand, or replace the incumbent world.

## Modes

The mode names what the visitor's success looks like on this surface.

- **Persuade:** the visitor decides and acts; design is the product. Landing pages, marketing, campaigns, pricing. Earn attention and action. Ship real imagery when the brief needs it; follow the committed world, not category habit.
- **Operate:** the visitor completes a task. App UI, dashboards, editors, admin, settings, tools. Scanability, consistency, native expectations, and the real usage scene outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details.
- **Read:** the visitor understands something. Docs, articles, guides, help, changelogs. Structure for comprehension, then make the reading experience worth staying in.
- **Experience:** the visitor is inside the work itself. Portfolios, galleries, showcases. Let the artifact lead from the first viewport; the interface recedes.

Choose the mode from the requested surface, not the product, and persist it only in that surface brief. A tool's landing page is still Persuade; a fashion house's documentation is still Read; a docs index is Read, not Persuade. See [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for new surfaces and [operate.md](reference/operate.md) for deeper Operate/Read guidance.

Routing:

- **Bare invocation without an actionable request:** read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and present its context-aware menu. An existing task does not need a menu just because no sub-command was named.
- **Explicit or clearly implied command:** load its reference, using the native variant where applicable. Choose the closest fit; ask only if the choice changes user intent or scope.
- **Otherwise:** use new-work for new surfaces or a requested replacement world; refine existing code in place for scoped changes. Missing context files do not force init when available evidence is sufficient.
- `teach` aliases `init`. `craft` is a deprecated alias for ordinary new-work and adds nothing. `shape` owns task discovery, then enters new-work only for visual-world and surface-concept decisions.

After init writes PRODUCT.md, resume without rerunning `context.mjs`; init loads the native platform reference itself when the platform it recorded is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`.

**Pin / Unpin:** `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>` creates or removes a standalone `$<command>` shortcut. Report the result or actionable error with secrets redacted.

**Hooks:** `$impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project (auto-runs the detector after UI file edits and surfaces findings). Load [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when the user invokes it with any argument.

**Doctor:** `$impeccable doctor` handles drift in product/design docs, sidecars, config, surface briefs, and hooks. Load [reference/doctor.md](reference/doctor.md) for explicit diagnosis or repair requests. Report `CONTEXT_STALE` findings without running doctor or repairing drift unasked.

**Never repair drift as a side effect of a design task.** A `CONTEXT_STALE` finding is reported, not acted on, unless the user asks. The one exception is a finding marked `auto`, which the next write to that file performs anyway.
